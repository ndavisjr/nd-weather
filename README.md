This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

React JS, Redux (actions, reducers), Styled Components, React Slick, React Router Dom, Firebase

severe - bookmarks are broken up into categories for quicker access to specific links. Those categories are the following pages: <br />
satellit<br />
tropical <br />
severe satellit<br /> 
tropical <br /><br />
about - description of me and some social links

### Note:

This page was designed in React (using VSCode) for the purpose of learning React. It is not meant for a crazy sweet production use. Oauth is implemented and its purpose in this site only provides access to the navigation menu. It is NOT responsive nor will it probably ever be. The amount of data and links to display (if I ever have time to fully implement it) would not make sense for a mobile device. It's best rendered on a bigger screen or on desktop-mode.
